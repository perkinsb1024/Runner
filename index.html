                        Runner is simple 2D-platformer game from 1993. It was made by a company called SouthBay Software (which may or may not still <a href="http://www.southbaypc.com/" target="_blank">exist</a>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Despite being quite simple by today's standards, when I found a copy on an old hard-drive backup, I was thrilled! Unfortunately, the only way to play the game was by running a Windows XP virtual machine and the game controls were significantly worse than I remember, making it very difficult to play. I decided to use this as a challenge and a learning opportunity and try to recreate the game using JavaScript and HTML5 in less than 30 days. This is the result.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I tried to stay as true to the original game as possible, using the same image and audio assets, levels and (to the best of my abilities) AI algorithms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you remember this game, I hope it lives up to your memories! And if you happen to be from SouthBay Software, please don't sue me :)

                <h1>How to Play</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You have run out of fuel and are stranded on a strange planet and must negotiate your way through a variety of levels to escape to the planet surface.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The only way to transverse from level to level is to trigger all of the red control lights <img src="images/src/switch_off.png" /> to a green  <img src="images/src/switch_on.png" /> [ON] condition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Turning on a control light may gain you a telepod <img src="images/src/telepod.png" />. As you progress in levels the telepods become scarcer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You must also collect the neutrino fuel canister <img src="images/src/can.png" /> to escape the level.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The enemy runner, <img src="images/src/run_right_pink_2.png" /> meanwhile will attempt to thwart your efforts, by turning control lights <img src="images/src/switch_off.png" /> back off and by trying to catch you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You may use any telepods <img src="images/src/telepod.png" /> you collect to teleport the enemy runner away from you. But, you may only use one telepod at a time. Drop them in the path of the enemy runner and, when he runs into it, he will teleport to another location.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you have successfully turned on all of the control lights <img src="images/src/switch_on.png" /> and collected the neutrino fuel canister <img src="images/src/can.png" />, run for the doorway <img src="images/src/door.png" /> to escape to the next level.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Additionally, you may encounter four different kinds of marbles while running. Reach them before your opponent does to activate them. Purple marbles <img src="images/src/marble_purple.png" /> will earn back 10% of the time while red marbles <img src="images/src/marble_red.png" /> will deplete 10% of the time. Light gray marbles <img src="images/src/marble_light_gray.png" /> will gain you an extra telepod and dark grey marbles <img src="images/src/marble_dark_gray.png" /> will instantly teleport whichever player touches them.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Use the arrow keys to control your player. Pressing the space bar will cause him to jump and pressing shift will deploy a telepod.
