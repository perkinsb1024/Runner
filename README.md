# Runner

Runner is a simple 2D platformer game from 1993. When I discovered a copy of it in a backup of one of my old computers, I was really excited, until I realized that in order to run it, I needed to set up a Windows 98 virtual machine, and even still, the game tended to crash a lot. With this in mind, I decided to do my best to faithfully recreate the game using JavaScript.
